            <h2>What&#39;s methods:</h2>
                When discussing cyber methods in a professional context, we're talking about the various <strong>strategies</strong>, <strong>techniques</strong> & <strong>practices</strong> used in the realm of <mark><code>cybersecurity</code></mark>.<br>
              Cyber methods include a broad spectrum of actions taken to <strong>safeguard digital assets</strong>, <strong>mitigate risks</strong>, <strong>detect & respond threats</strong> & ensure the overall security of information systems.<br>
In simple words it's the toolbox of <strong>techniques</strong> & <strong>strategies</strong> used to keep digital information safe from the bad guys" who might try to steal or damage it.
            <h3>Several key areas of the methods:</h3>
            <ul><h4>Preventative Measures (Keeping Bad Guys Out):</h4></ul>
            <ul><ul>
                <li>These are proactive strategies (virtual barriers & locks) designed to stop cyber threats before they can cause harm.</li>
                <li>These include implementing robust <strong>access controls</strong>, <strong>firewalls</strong>, <strong>encryption</strong> & <strong>security policies</strong> to protect against unauthorized access & data breaches.</li>
            </ul></ul>
            <ul><h4>Detection Techniques (Spotting Trouble Early):</h4></ul>
            <ul><ul>
                <li>ADetection methods involve using tools that act as alarms, alerting if something fishy is happening on the systems, like having a digital watchdog that barks if it senses danger.</li>
                <li>This may involve <strong>real-time monitoring</strong>, <strong>intrusion detection</strong> systems & <strong>threat intelligence feeds</strong> to detect abnormal behaviour or indicators of compromise.</li>
            </ul></ul>
            <ul><h4>Incident Response (Dealing with Emergencies):</h4></ul>
            <ul><ul>
                <li>When a security incident occurs, effective incident response methods are essential for containing the <strong>threat</strong>, <strong>minimizing damage</strong> & <strong>restoring</strong> normal operations as quickly as possible, like having a fire drill for computer problems.</li>
                <li>This involves having <strong>predefined incident response plans</strong>, <strong>trained personnel</strong> & <strong>appropriate tools & resources</strong> to investigate, mitigate & recover from security breaches.</li>
            </ul></ul>
            <ul><h4>Forensics and Investigation (Investigating What Went Wrong):</h4></ul>
            <ul><ul>
                <li>The cyber forensics methods are used to <strong>gather</strong> & <strong>analyse</strong> digital evidence related to security incidents or cybercrimes, like being a digital detective, gathering clues to catch the cyber-criminal.</li>
                <li>Often involves techniques as <strong>disk imaging</strong>, <strong>memory analysis</strong> & <strong>network forensics</strong> to reconstruct <strong>events</strong>, <strong>identify perpetrators</strong> & <strong>support legal proceedings</strong>.</li>
            </ul></ul>
            <ul><h4>Risk Management (Managing Risks):</h4></ul>
            <ul><ul>
                <li>Cyber risk management methods involve <strong>assessing</strong> & <strong>prioritizing</strong> risks to an organization's information assets & implementing controls to mitigate those risks to an acceptable level.</li>
                <li>In simple words It's like weighing the chances of something bad happening & taking steps to lower those risks.</li>
                <li>This includes <strong>conducting</strong> risk assessments, establishing risk <strong>tolerance levels</strong> & implementing security controls based on <strong>identified risks</strong>.</li>
            </ul></ul>
            <ul><h4>Security Awareness and Training (Teaching People to Be Safe):</h4></ul>
            <ul><ul>
                <li>Human factors play a significant role in cybersecurity, so methods for educating & training employees about security best practices are essential. </li>
                <li>Like teaching everyone in the office how to lock up properly & not to share their passwords with strangers.</li>
                <li>Usually includes raising <strong>awareness</strong> about <strong>common threats</strong>, providing <strong>training</strong> on <strong>secure behaviours</strong> & <strong>conducting simulated phishing exercises</strong> to test & improve employee vigilance.</li>
            </ul></ul><br>
        </section>
        <section id="Techniques Explanaion">
            <h2>What&#39;s techniques:</h2>
                In the realm of cybersecurity, the terms <strong>techniques</strong> & <strong>methods</strong> are often used <strong>interchangeably</strong>, but they do carry diffrent meanings:<br>
            <h3>Techniques:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Techniques are the specific tricks or actions used to tackle cybersecurity tasks.</li>
                <li>They're like individual tools in a toolbox, each serving a specific purpose.</li>
                <li><mark><code>Example</code></mark>: using <strong>passwords</strong>, <strong>encryption</strong>, or <strong>firewalls</strong> are techniques.</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <h3>Methods:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Methods are the bigger plans or strategies followed to keep the digital stuff safe.</li>
                <li>They're like the blueprints guiding how to use those tools effectively.</li>
                <li><mark><code>Example</code></mark>: having a plan for <strong>regular security checks</strong>, <strong>training employees</strong> on safe online behaviour, or <strong>setting up emergency response</strong> procedures are methods.</li>
            </ul><br>
So basically  <strong>techniques</strong> are the little actions, while <strong>methods</strong> are the bigger-picture plans guiding those actions.<br>
