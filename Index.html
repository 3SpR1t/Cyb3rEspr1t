<h2>What&#39;s Methods:</h2>
</section>
<ul>
<li><p>When discussing cyber methods in a professional context, we&#39;re talking about the various <strong>strategies</strong>, <strong>techniques</strong> &amp; <strong>practices</strong> used in the realm of <mark><code>cybersecurity</code></mark>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Cyber methods include a broad spectrum of actions taken to <strong>safeguard digital assets</strong>, <strong>mitigate risks</strong>, <strong>detect &amp; respond threats</strong> &amp; ensure the overall security of information systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In simple words it&#39;s the toolbox of <strong>techniques</strong> &amp; <strong>strategies</strong> used to keep digital information safe from the bad guys&quot; who might try to steal or damage it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> Several key areas of the methods:</p>
<h4 id="preventative-measures-keeping-bad-guys-out"><strong>Preventative Measures</strong> (Keeping Bad Guys Out):</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>These are proactive strategies (virtual barriers &amp; locks) designed to stop cyber threats before they can cause harm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These include implementing robust <strong>access controls</strong>, <strong>firewalls</strong>, <strong>encryption</strong> &amp; <strong>security policies</strong> to protect against unauthorized access &amp; data breaches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="detection-techniques-spotting-trouble-early"><strong>Detection Techniques</strong> (Spotting Trouble Early):</h4>
<ul>

<li>This may involve <strong>real-time monitoring</strong>, <strong>intrusion detection</strong> systems &amp; <strong>threat intelligence feeds</strong> to detect abnormal behaviour or indicators of compromise.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="incident-response-dealing-with-emergencies"><strong>Incident Response</strong> (Dealing with Emergencies):</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>When a security incident occurs, effective incident response methods are essential for containing the <strong>threat</strong>, <strong>minimizing damage</strong> &amp; <strong>restoring</strong> normal operations as quickly as possible, like having a fire drill for computer problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This involves having <strong>predefined incident response plans</strong>, <strong>trained personnel</strong> &amp; <strong>appropriate tools &amp; resources</strong> to investigate, mitigate &amp; recover from security breaches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="forensics-and-investigation-investigating-what-went-wrong"><strong>Forensics and Investigation</strong> (Investigating What Went Wrong):</h4>

</li>
<li><p>This includes <strong>conducting</strong> risk assessments, establishing risk <strong>tolerance levels</strong> &amp; implementing security controls based on <strong>identified risks</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="security-awareness-and-training-teaching-people-to-be-safe"><strong>Security Awareness and Training</strong> (Teaching People to Be Safe):</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Human factors play a significant role in cybersecurity, so methods for educating &amp; training employees about security best practices are essential. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Like teaching everyone in the office how to lock up properly &amp; not to share their passwords with strangers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Usually includes raising <strong>awareness</strong> about <strong>common threats</strong>, providing <strong>training</strong> on <strong>secure behaviours</strong> &amp; <strong>conducting simulated phishing exercises</strong> to test &amp; improve employee vigilance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<section id="Techniques Explanaion">
<h2>What&#39;s Techniques:</h2>
<section>
<p>In the realm of cybersecurity, the terms <strong>techniques</strong> &amp; <strong>methods</strong> are often used <strong>interchangeably</strong>, but they do carry diffrent meanings:</p>
<h4 id="techniques">Techniques:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Techniques are the specific tricks or actions used to tackle cybersecurity tasks.</li>
<li>They&#39;re like individual tools in a toolbox, each serving a specific purpose.</li>
<li><mark><code>Example</code></mark>: using <strong>passwords</strong>, <strong>encryption</strong>, or <strong>firewalls</strong> are techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="methods">Methods:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Methods are the bigger plans or strategies followed to keep the digital stuff safe.</li>
<li>They&#39;re like the blueprints guiding how to use those tools effectively.</li>
<li><mark><code>Example</code></mark>: having a plan for <strong>regular security checks</strong>, <strong>training employees</strong> on safe online behaviour, or <strong>setting up emergency response</strong> procedures are methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>techniques</strong> are the little actions, while <strong>methods</strong> are the bigger-picture plans guiding those actions.</p>
